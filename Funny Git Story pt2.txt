The developers, led by the wise and pragmatic Senior Coder, Walter Mergebottom, were skeptical. They were used to the tried-and-true Git model they had been using for years. Walter argued, "Why fix what isn't broken? Let's stick to what we know and avoid unnecessary chaos." However, the enthusiastic Junior Coders, ever eager to embrace the latest trends, were immediately onboard with Zigzaggit. They saw it as an opportunity to explore new horizons and show off their skills.

As debates raged on, the project managers, ever the mediators, tried to find common ground. They organized countless meetings, complete with endless PowerPoint presentations and charts comparing the pros and cons of Zigzaggit. The company was divided into factions, each passionately defending their stance on the Git strategy.
